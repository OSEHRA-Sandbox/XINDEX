OSEHRA XINDEX
==============

This source tree holds a reference copy of M components for XINDEX, the
tool designed for reporting cross-references and compliance with the SAC.  It
is maintained by OSEHRA, the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance.

-------
Purpose
-------

It has been found that XINDEX doesn't run or report on all VistA components
that can be contained within a KIDS build. This creates errors of omission
when trying to find other code references or compliance with the SAC.
