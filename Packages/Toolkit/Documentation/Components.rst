Components already supported by XINDEX
--------------------------------------

XINDEX already supports various components:

 * FILES
 * ROUTINES
 * OPTION

XINDEX supports these non-routine components by creating Faux routines and using them as input to XINDEX.

There appears to be support for templates, but I haven't been able to find a package that has anything to report in XINDEX.
